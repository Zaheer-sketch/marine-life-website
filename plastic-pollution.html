            <p>Plastic pollution is a major threat to marine life. Millions of tons of plastic enter the oceans each year, harming wildlife and ecosystems. Marine animals often ingest plastic or become entangled in it.</p>
            <h2>Effects of Plastic Pollution</h2>
            <p>Plastic can break down into microplastics, which are consumed by small marine organisms and can enter the food chain, posing health risks to humans and marine life alike.</p>
            <h2>Combating Plastic Pollution</h2>
            <p>Efforts to combat plastic pollution include reducing plastic use, increasing recycling efforts, and supporting legislation aimed at reducing plastic waste. Community clean-up events and awareness campaigns are also effective.</p>
