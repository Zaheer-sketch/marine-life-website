            <p>Coral reefs are vital ecosystems that support a diverse range of marine life. They provide habitat, food, and protection for many species. Unfortunately, they are threatened by climate change, pollution, and overfishing.</p>
            <h2>Importance of Coral Reefs</h2>
            <p>Coral reefs are often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea" due to their biodiversity. They play a crucial role in coastal protection and support fisheries that millions of people rely on for their livelihoods.</p>
            <h2>How to Protect Coral Reefs</h2>
            <p>Protecting coral reefs involves reducing carbon emissions, minimizing pollution, and supporting sustainable fishing practices. Community involvement and awareness are also essential for conservation efforts.</p>
