            <h2>About Octopuses</h2>
            <img src="images/octopus.jpg" alt="Octopus" />
            <p>Octopuses are known for their intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and unique behaviors. They are soft-bodied cephalopods that inhabit various marine environments.</p>
            <h3>Habitat</h3>
            <p>Octopuses are found in oceans worldwide, from shallow coastal waters to deep-sea environments. They often hide in crevices and caves to avoid predators.</p>
            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>Octopuses primarily feed on crustaceans, fish, and other small marine animals. They use their beak-like mouths to break open shells and capture prey.</p>
            <h3>Adaptations</h3>
            <p>Octopuses have remarkable adaptations, including the ability to change color and texture to blend in with their surroundings, as well as the ability to squirt ink to escape predators.</p>
            <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
            <p>While many octopus species are not currently endangered, overfishing and habitat destruction pose threats to their populations. Sustainable fishing practices are important for their conservation.</
