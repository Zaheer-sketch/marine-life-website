            <img src="images/blue-whale.jpg" alt="Blue Whale" />
            <p>The blue whale is the largest animal known to have ever existed. They can reach lengths of up to 100 feet and weigh as much as 200 tons. Blue whales are known for their incredible size and their deep, resonant calls.</p>
            <h3>Habitat</h3>
            <p>Blue whales are found in all the world's oceans, often in deep waters away from the coast.</p>
            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>These giants primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill. During feeding season, a blue whale can consume up to 4 tons of krill per day.</p>
            <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
            <p>Blue whales are currently listed as endangered due to past whaling practices. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect their populations.</p>
